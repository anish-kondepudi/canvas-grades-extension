**Notes:**

_- For the Chrome Extension to function properly, the user must be on tile view on their Canvas Dashboard_
_- Currently, the Extension is only functional for Student's of UC Davis_
_- At the moment there is a bug which shows ALL grades for even previous courses, this will be fixed in future updates_
